        <img src="images/teaimage.webp" class="image box1" alt="old image of pioneers of tea " >
        <p>
           Introduced in 1867, Ceylon Tea has grown to be the top agriculture export in Sri Lanka and 
            provides direct and indirect employment to nearly 1 million people while around 4% of the country’s
            land area is covered in tea plantations amounting to nearly 203,000 hectares.<br><br>
            The humidity, cool temperatures, and rainfall of the country's central highlands provide a climate that
            favors the production of high-quality tea. On the other hand, tea produced in low-elevation
            areas such as Matara, Galle and Rathnapura districts with high rainfall and warm temperature
            has high level of astringent properties. The tea biomass production itself is higher in
            low-elevation areas. Such tea is popular in the Middle East. <br><br>Sri Lanka produces mostly 
            orthodox black teas but also produces CTC, white and green teas. The two types of green tea
            produced are the gunpowder type and sencha. The industry was introduced to the country in 
            1867 by James Taylor, a British planter who arrived in 1852. Tea planting under smallholder
            conditions has become popular in the 1970s. Most of Sri Lanka's export market is in the
            Middle East and Europe but there are also plenty of bidders worldwide for its specialty-country
             grown Nuwara Eliya teas.

        <h3>Classification Of Teas</h3>
            <img src="images/tea2.webp" class="image box2" alt="tea cup contaning tea" >
        <p>The most important classification is by the manufacturing process, resulting in the three categories : 
         <ol type="I" class=".list">
                <li>Fermented (black)</li>
                <li>Semi-Fermented (green)</li>  <!--ordered list--> <!--indent or add a margin -->
                <li>Unfermented(oolong)</li>
         </ol>
           
                Teas are also classified by the size of the processed leaf. Traditional operations result in 
                larger leafy grades and smaller broken grades. The leafy grades are flowery pekoe (FP), orange
                pekoe (OP), pekoe (P), pekoe souchong (PS), and souchong (S). The broken grades are: broken
                orange pekoe (BOP), broken pekoe (BP), BOP fanning, fannings, and dust. Broken grades usually
                have substantial contributions from the more tender shoots, while leafy grades come mainly 
                from the tougher and more mature leaves. In modern commercial grading, 95 to 100 percent of
                production belongs to broken grades, whereas earlier a substantial quantity of leafy grades
                was produced. This shift has been caused by an increased demand for teas of smaller particle
                size, which produce a quick, strong brew.

        <h3>Types Of Teas</h3>
        <img src="images/tea types.webp" class="image box3" alt="image of different teas">
        <p>There are five areas where tea is grown in Sri Lanka, each yielding a different flavour and taste
           of tea. Tea originated from the Camellia Sinensis plant, but it’s the weather, soil and elevation
           of the tea plantation that brings about this change in flavour and taste.</p>
        <ul class=".list"> <!--Unordered list-->
            <li><b>Ceylon Black Tea : </b>World renowned and the most popular in the market. Tea leaves are
                 plucked by the skilled hands of tea-pluckers, where only two leaves and the bud is nipped off.
                  Once the leaves are collected, they are then left to wither, before being rolled, fermented,
                   dried and finally sifted. Once the sifting process is complete, they are separated into 
                   different grades of tea. Each grade of black tea has different colors and intensities.</li><br>
            <li><b>Green Tea : </b>The second most popular type of Ceylon tea. Once plucked from the same<i> Camellia
                 Sinensis </i>bush, the leaves are withered, heated and then rolled, before being dried and sifted.
                  To make green tea, the process of fermentation is skipped.</li> <br>  
            <li><b>White Tea : </b>Special and exclusive type of Ceylon tea and quite possibly the most 
                expensive due to its rarity. White tea is often referred to as Silver Tips. To make white tea, 
                only the buds from the tea plant are plucked at dawn. They are hand rolled individually and
                 not fermented. White tea is light in colour and subtle when compared to Ceylon black tea, and 
                 is packed with more antioxidants than the other two types of tea, thus making it one of the 
                 healthiest beverages.</li>

        <h3>More About Ceylon Tea</h3>
        <img src="images/lion logo.webp"  class="image box4" alt="image of Ceylon lion logo">
        <p>
            Ceylon Tea’s distinct flavour is also governed by it being exclusively handpicked mainly according
            to the two leaves and bud method, and almost 93% of the Ceylon Tea produced annually is produced
            according to artisanal and orthodox methods compared to CTC method practiced worldwide .<br><br>
            At present, a larger portion of the country’s tea is exported as Ceylon Black Tea, while the
            country also produces Ceylon Green Tea, a type developed from Assamese seedlings. Ceylon White
            Tea, namely silver and golden tips is celebrated around the world for their finest flavour and 
            are among the most expensive tea varieties in the world. <br><br>
            Ceylon Tea industry maintains the highest quality in the global tea market and ISO 3720 is the 
            minimum standard applies for the products. The country has the capability to produce the cleanest
            tea in the world in terms of minimum pesticide residues. <br><br>
            Sri Lankan tea planters have also entered into partnerships with Fair Trade Certification, Ethical
            Tea Partnership, Rainforest Alliance, Ozone Friendly Tea, Carbon Neutral Certification, and  
            Organic Certifications including USDA - NOP, JAS, EU, and NASAA) .
